# Grunt Basic Web Project

The idea is to create a basic web template I can take to easily start a new projekt powered by grunt.

Actually it is used to create local overwrites for a website but in the future it also should be used to create normal websites.

it includes 
- css post-processors (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-postcss)
- sass css preprocessor scripting language (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-sass)
- file watcher for sass-files
- a modular css compressor (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssnano)
- development deploy
- production deploy
- custom config with json
- grunt just in time extention loader (jit-grunt)
